				<h5 class="bg-secondary p-2">Objectives of HMI:</h5>
				<p>
					In the HMI project, your team produces an "intelligent" and highly user-friendly interface.
					You must use vue.js or Bootstrap for the development of the interface.
					The further objective of your software development is either a news ticker providing the latest breaking news on a band (one line) continuously scrolling on the bottom of a web page (which can be blank).
					The news presented can be handled by the users. They should focus on a particular topic such as sports, cooking, lyrics, football, cars, trains, ships, plants, gardening, or the like.
					or (if the project links to the TADS course, too) a management system for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Bag of Words produced in that project. The topic can be the same.
				</p>
				<h5 class="bg-secondary p-2">Objectives of TAaDS:</h5>
				<p>
					You are expected to develop an information extraction application that uses its own Named Entity Recognition (NER) process and produces different Bag of Words where the instances of the recognition processes are stored.
					You may choose any kind of text collection (addressing, for instance, cooking, cars, lyrics, politics, etc.). However, I welcome applications operating on the Enron files available on the courseâ€™s site here.
					You are expected to find at least a dozen patterns for Named Entities and at least 150 entries in Bag of Words. You are also expected to be aware of the limitations of your NER and to discuss and present these limitations.
					There are no restrictions on the programming language. Bag of Words should be stored in text or JSON format.
				</p>
				<h5 class="bg-secondary p-2">Using Procegure:</h5>
				<p>
					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
